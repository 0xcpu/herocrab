## What is this?

Currently this is my `Rust` playground aka bug farm.

The (far) goal is to compete (:D) with:
- [pafish](https://github.com/a0rtega/pafish)
- [al-khaser](https://github.com/LordNoteworthy/al-khaser)

But by providing amap functionalities in a lib for `Windows` and `Linux` (and `MacOS` ofc).
